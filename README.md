# Soccer-Science
Predict English Premier League soccer match outcomes and beat the bookies with XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression models.

This project was completed as part of the Insight Data Science Program. It was my first full end-to-end web application and live machine learning model.

The application was deployed on an AWS EC2 instance running Python Flask and provided predictions based on the home and away teams, and the latest odds on the future match from the bookies.
